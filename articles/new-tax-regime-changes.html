        <h1>New Tax Regime Changes Explained (FY 2025-26)</h1>
        <p>The Union Budget brought significant updates to the new tax regime for the Financial Year 2025-26 (Assessment Year 2026-27). These changes are designed to provide relief to taxpayers and simplify the tax structure. Here are the key highlights:</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Key Changes at a Glance:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Higher Rebate Limit:</strong> No tax payable on income up to ₹12,00,000.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Standard Deduction:</strong> Raised to ₹75,000 for salaried individuals.</li>
                <li><strong>New Tax Slabs:</strong> The income brackets have been revised.</li>
                <li><strong>Updated Capital Gains Tax:</strong> STCG is now taxed at 20% and LTCG at 12.5%.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Increased Rebate Limit (Section 87A)</h2>
        <p>The most significant change is the increase in the tax rebate limit. Under the new regime, if your net taxable income is up to <strong>₹12,00,000</strong>, your final tax liability will be zero. This provides substantial relief to a large number of taxpayers.</p>

        <h2>2. Higher Standard Deduction</h2>
        <p>For salaried individuals and pensioners, the standard deduction under the new tax regime has been increased from ₹50,000 to <strong>₹75,000</strong>. This directly reduces your taxable salary income.</p>

        <h2>3. Revised Tax Slabs</h2>
        <p>The income tax slabs for the new regime have been restructured to offer lower tax rates at various income levels. The new slabs are designed to ensure a smoother and more gradual increase in the tax rate as income rises.</p>

        <h2>4. Changes in Capital Gains Taxation</h2>
        <p>The tax rates for capital gains on listed equities have been updated. Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) are now taxed at <strong>20%</strong>, while Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) are taxed at <strong>12.5%</strong> on gains exceeding the exemption limit of ₹1,25,000.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>What does this mean for you?</strong> These changes make the new tax regime a more attractive option for many taxpayers, especially those who do not have significant deductions to claim under the old regime.
